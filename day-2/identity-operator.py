# Python Identity Operators
# Identity operators are used to compare the objects,
# not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:



# a = 2020
# b = a
#
# c = a is b
#
# print(c)



# a = 20
# b = 20
#
# c = a is b
#
# print(c)
#
# print("a memory size",id(a))
# print("b memory size",id(b))


# a = 202020
# b = 202020
#
# c = a is not b
# print(c)
# print("a memory size",id(a))
# print("b memory size",id(b))
