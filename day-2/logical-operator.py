# Python Logical Operators
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

# and

# a = 25
# b = 30
# c = 40

# d = (a>b) and (b<c)
#
# print(d)


# or operator

# a = 25
# b = 30
# c = 40
#
# d = (a>b) or (a>c)
#
# print(d)


# not
a = 25
b = 30
c = 40

d = not((a<b) and  (a<c))

print(d)
